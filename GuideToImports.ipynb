    "Before we can start talking about importing Python code from various places, we need to first discuss the places in which Python code lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "Python code lives in files that end in \".py\". \n",
    "In Python-speak, a file that ends in \".py\" is also a **module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's write some Python code to create a dinner plate and put it in a file named ```dinner_plate.py```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`dinner_plate.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DinnerPlate( object ):\n",
    "    def __repr__( self ):\n",
    "        return \"DinnerPlate()\"\n",

    "\n",
    "We're currently inside of the `GuideToImports.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, and right beside us is a single file named `dinner_plate.py`. Since Python files are modules, we could also say that we have a single module named `dinner_plate`. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a weird convention here that we need to talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we mentioned the file, we called it `dinner_plate.py`. But when we mentioned the module, we called it `dinner_plate`. There's only one object here, but we use two different names for it. When we're talking about this object as a file, we call it `dinner_plate.py` - *with* the \".py\". But when we're talking about this object as a module, we call it `dinner_plate` - *without* the \".py\".\n",

    "\n",
    "With relative imports, we **don't** have to include the name of every pacakge in our path. Instead, we can use special nicknames that Python assigns to packages depending on their position **relative** to where we are.\n",

    "\n",
    "Is the extra flexibility of relative imports worth sacrificing the clarity of absolute imports? Perhaps not. These days, most text-editors and IDEs are capable of automatically renaming things for us -- we don't *need* the flexibility of relative imports. \n",

    "2. What does Python mean by **No module named 'vehicle'?** Vehicle is a **package!** And it's right **there!**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what's going on, we need to understand how Python actually finds modules to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Python Finds Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python starts up, it creates a giant list of places where it'll look for modules that we want to import. If our module isn't in one of those places on the list, Python won't find it and all sorts of nasty errors will pop up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This giant list of places is actually just a variable named `path` that lives inside of Python's built-in `sys` module. It's just a regular Python list with regular Python strings inside of it. We can import it and muck around with it just like any other list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weirdly enough, the list `sys.path` starts out *completely empty*. There's nothing there, and if it stayed that way, we wouldn't be able to import anything. Luckily, Python automatically adds some things to `sys.path`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python adds the directory containing all of Python's built-in modules\n",
    "2. Python adds the directory containing all of the extra packages we've personally installed\n",
    "3. And if we run a Python file (like we did just a minute ago), Python adds the directory containing the file we ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is super interesting or whatever, BUT WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN???**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our error noted that Python couldn't find the `vehicles` package, so `vehicles` must not have been in `sys.path`!\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's think about what **was** in `sys.path`. As per above, `sys.path` has the directory containing all of the built-in modules, the directory containing all of our installed modules, and finally, `sys.path` has the directory containing the file we ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we ran `python vehicles/trucks/chevy.py`, the directory containing `chevy.py` was `trucks/`. So, the `trucks/` direcgtory got added in `sys.path`. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the problem? The `vehicles/` directory never got added to `sys.path`! This means that our import statement inside of the `chevy` module... \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from vehicles.engines.truck_engine import TruckEngine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...completely fails because Python cannot find the `vehicles/` part of our path! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So... Can We Fix This? Or Can We Never Run Python Code Again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there's the naive solution: right before Python reaches our `from vehicles.engines.truck_engine ...` import statement, we could manually add the `vehicles/` directory to `sys.path`. After all, `sys.path` is just a list. We can add things to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would work... but it is a **horrible** solution. It it just so hacky, so adhoc, and so ugly. It is also annoying: we don't want to add this...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys.path\n",
    "sys.path.append( \"some/path/to/some/place\" )`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...to the top of every file that might have a problematic import. That's terrible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Luckily, There Is Another Way!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of running the **file** `vehicles/trucks/chevy.py`, we can instead run the **module** `vehicles.trucks.chevy`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run the **module** `chevy`, Python does something slightly different to `sys.path` than when we ran the **file** `chevy.py`. Instead of adding the directory containing the **file** (which was `/trucks`), Python will add our current directory to `sys.path`.\n",
